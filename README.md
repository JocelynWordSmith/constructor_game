constructor_game
================

basic fighting system using constructors

this is a very simple game running in JavaScript where the player can fight goblins. The goblins increase in difficulty
the more you kill. There are three different classes to play as, each with their own stats, and there are three 
type of generated goblins. The goal is to kill ten goblins.

It was an experiment in working with constructors and prototypes.
